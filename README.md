# SDEV-300 Final Project

## Description

Create a Flask website with Python that has multiple pages. Each page should have a title, a header, and a body.

There should be one route that allows the user to sign up for the website. The user should be able to enter their name, email, and password.

Another route should allow the user to log in. The user should be able to enter their email and password.

The website should log all failed login attempts.

Create custom templates for the website which enable you to re-use the same HTML for multiple pages.

Incorporate JSON for the data to be stored in the database.

If you feel is necessary, add any styling and interactivity to the website with CSS and JavaScript.
